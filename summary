The Project Folder contains all the necessary files.

The files i have modified are in src folder.

I have commented my cout commands in the KalmanFilter.cpp because i've seen errors with cout thought I used namespace std in the code.

I have included screenshot of my test on simulator and command terminal in the project folder.
